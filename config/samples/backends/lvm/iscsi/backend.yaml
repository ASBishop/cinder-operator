# This sample requires an LVM VG with the name of `cinder-volumes` to exist on the OpenShift node where cinder-volume runs
# It also requires that iscsid and multpathd are running on the host.
# The correct way to configure and run the daemons is using `MachineConfig` as shown in `iscsid.yaml` and `multipathd.yaml`.
# To create the LVM on CRC the sample also uses a `MachineConfig` using a systemd unit with file `lvm.yaml`
#
# ATTENTION:
# - Node where we want LVM to run needs to be labeled with openstack.org/cinder-lvm
# - After applying this OpenShift nodes will reboot, because of the `MachineConfig` changes and will take a while to recover.
